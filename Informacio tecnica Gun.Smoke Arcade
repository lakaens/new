Gun.Smoke © 1985 Capcom Company, Limited.

Gun.Smoke is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Wild West, in which the player takes the role of a Billy; a young Sheriff charged with hunting down and killing a number of infamous 'Wanted' outlaws.

Each level is packed with gun-toting bandits and the Sheriff must shoot his way through the stage, before finally taking on the wanted outlaw 'boss' character at the end. Each outlaw wields a special weapon unique to them, such as a Winchester rifle, knives, darts or boomerangs.

Shooting the barrels that litter the levels reveals power-ups such as boots (for extra speed), rifles (for increased range) and bullets (for rapid fire). The game's 3 directional fire buttons (for firing left, right or ahead) can be combined (pressed Simultaneously) to create a total of 8 different firing directions.

TIPS AND TRICKS
• An Interesting Bug : When you're on Level 2, make sure you have a horse when you kill Roy Knife. Once he is dead, walk over his corpse and your horse will be killed. Roy raises from the dead as a sort of indestructible zombie. You can shoot him as much as you like, but he won't die. In this way you can play until you get tired of it. 

• Secrect Character : If the total of inserted credit (NOT current credit) is a multiple of 16 (16, 32, 48...), the secret character 'Aka-jirou' (Red-dragonfly) appears and you can get 10000 pts when you kill it. 
The number of dragonflies at one time is changed by current total inserted credit, for example : 64 credits = 4 dragonflies, 128 credits = 8 dragonfiles. 
But in case of 256 credits, 50 dragonflies appear instead of 16!
